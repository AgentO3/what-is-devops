## Values Meaningful Work

!

## DevOps In Action At VividCortex

A Reasonably Plausible Scenario

!

Jim (a customer) files issue in Intercom.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/vEdArhTXiSruhRr/1Jim_Intercom1.png)

!

Data is missing data in his graphs.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/pfd0HhMQNyK37bR/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.18.48%20PM.png)

!

John our Ops guy is on call and he is immediately notified in HipChat.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/hIwhTTOtzOkkBIZ/3hipchatIssueAlert.png)

!

He let's Jim know he is looking into the problem.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/MpAD4uc28NZdCZC/4lookingIntoProblem.png)

!

John impersonates Jim and verifies data is really missing


![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/2QZTYznGDv4AuTN/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.17.22%20PM.png)

!

John checks to see when last deploy of agents happened.

!

He runs the ChatOps command <br>"/last agents".

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/OJxebCQ7rmZA4ux/5LastAgents.png)


!

John does see any correlated between Jims missing data and the last deployment of agents.

!

John posts in HipChat and pings @here "Did anyone deploy something recently to production? Jim is missing data in his graphs".

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/hSSYyWisduCmALR/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.21.07%20PM.png)

!

Ale says "I recently deployed a change to Kafka consumers around that time frame".

!

John says "Let hangout and work together to solve Jim's problem".

!

John executes the command "/hangout backend" to start a +Google Hangout and pings @Ale to join.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/HvYKVCGvj1s4WkJ/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.23.31%20PM.png)

!

John shares his screen and runs "/kibana" command to get the Kibana log UI.

!

Together they filter the logs down to only kafka consumer output logs and find the error.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/vO8BJnJCj77fAWr/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.25.32%20PM.png)

!

They pair program and quickly resolve the bug in the code.

!

Ale says "See what the problem is. That never happens in our staging server, I would never caught that in testing!"

!

Ale commits his code to GitHub and merges it into masters.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/IyvhVpYikUY2l1D/Github.png)

!

With the ChatOps command "/release agents" Ale pushes the fixed agent to production.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/E5qIDjThud4ySXb/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.30.57%20PM.png)

!

While this is happening John updates the customer, letting them know the issue should be fixed in a few mins.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/O4OsuH6Ia2XZ62n/JohnUpdatesCustomer.png)

!

Thing (our hubot) notifies them that the deployment to production was successful.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/PGZNKMWig2jb5Df/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.31.04%20PM.png)

!

They both check the graphs in Jim's account and see that the issue is fixed.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/Wj6cg0qZlhhJ7wH/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%205.32.53%20PM.png)

!

John notifies Jim that their graphs are fixed.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/36114/483141/SXpScdslpesDQrm/GraphsFixedGladWeCouldHelp.png)

!

Total time to resolution is 15mins.
