- A Reasonably Plausible Scenario Of DevOps In Action At VividCortex
  - Jim (a customer) files issue in Intercom.
  - Data is missing data in his graphs.
  - John our Ops guy is on call and he is alerted to the problem in HipChat.
  - He let's Jim know he is looking into the problem.
  - John impersonates Jim and verifies data is really missing
  - John checks to see when last deploy of agents happened.
  - He runs the ChatOps command `/last agents`.
  - John does see any corroliated with Jims missing data and the last deployment of agents to production.
  - John posts in HipChat and pings @here "Did anyone deploy something recently to production? Jim is missing data in his graphs".
  - Ale says "I recently deployed a change to Kafka consumers around that time frame".
  - John says "Let hangout and work together to solve Jim's problem".
  - John executes the command `/hangout backend ` to start a +Google Hangout and ping @Ale to join.
  - John shares his screen and run `/kibana` command to get the Kibana log aggragation UI.
  - Together they filter the logs down to only kafka consumer output logs and find the error.
  - They pair program and quickly resolve the bug in the code.
  - Ale: "See what the problem is. That never happens in our staging server, I would never caught that in testing!"
  - Ale commits his code to GitHub and merges it into masters.
  - With the ChatOps command `/release agents` Ale pushes the fixed agent to production. 
  - while this is happening John updates the customer, letting them know the issue should be fixed in a few mins.
  - Thing (our hubot) notifies them that the deployment to production was successful.
  - They both check the graphs in Jim's account and see that the issue is fixed.
  - John notifies Jim that their graphs are fixed.
  - Total time to resolution 15mins.
