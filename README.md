  - Jim files issue in Intercom
  - Jim is missing data in graphs

  - John checks to see when last deploy of agents happened
  - In HipChat runs ChatOps command `\last agents`
  - Command shows the last deploy was not corroliated with Jims missing data
  - John posts posts in HipChat and pings @here to see if anyone has deployed anything that might affect Jim's data.
  - Ale says that he recently deployed a change to Kafka consumers around that time frame.
  - John goes to Kibana and filters the log aggragation to logs from the Kafka consumer services.
  - John starts a +Google hangout with Ale and reviews the logs together.
  - Together they find an error in the log that is an error that he did not account for happening in producton.
  - They pair program and quickly resolve the bug in the code.
  - Ale commits his code to GitHub and merges it into masters.
  - Ale push the change to production with ChatOps command `/release agents` while John updates the customer, letting them know the issue should be fixed in a few mins.
  - Thing notifies them that the deployment to production was successful.
  - They both check the graphs in Jim's account and see that the issue is fixed.
  - John notifies Jim that their graphs are fixed.
  - Total time to resolution 15mins.
